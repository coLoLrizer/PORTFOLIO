# Portfolio

A collection of my game design work across personal projects, prototypes, and system design studies.

### Included:
- **Orbital Strike — Ability Evolution Case Study**  
  A breakdown of how a single spell idea grew through three different design environments:  
  *fantasy → prototype → MMO-ready mechanic.*

- **Crimson Witch — Boss Encounter Design**  
  A full boss fight built around potion-based territory control, escalating phases, and “player-like” AI decisions.  
  *space denial → readable telegraphs → reward for adaptation under chaos.*

- **Monolith — Technical design of the ability**  
  The path of how simple mechanics are implemented in a prototype through stages 


More sections will be added as I publish additional design documents.

> More designs coming soon — several projects are currently in WIP / cleanup stage.
