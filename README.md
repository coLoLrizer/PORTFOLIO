# Portfolio

A collection of my game design work across personal projects, prototypes, and system design studies.

### Included:
- **Orbital Strike — Ability Evolution Case Study**  
  A breakdown of how a single spell idea grew through three different design environments:  
  *fantasy → prototype → MMO-ready mechanic.*

More sections will be added as I publish additional design documents.
